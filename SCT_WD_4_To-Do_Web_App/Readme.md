# To-Do Web App

This project showcases the skills I honed during my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, where we focused on developing real-world applications through practical experience. The To-Do Web App, as Task No. 4, demonstrates my proficiency in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** while highlighting interactive design, responsive layouts, and engaging user experiences.

## Features
- **Add New Tasks**: Add tasks by typing in the input field and pressing Enter or clicking the "+" button.
- **Edit Tasks**: Tasks can be edited, and edits are timestamped.
- **Mark as Completed**: Use checkboxes to mark tasks as complete, with a strikethrough effect.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Task Counter**: Tracks and displays completed vs. total tasks.
- **Local Storage**: Stores tasks locally to maintain state on page reload.

## Code Overview
### HTML
Defines the structure of the application, with sections for the header, task input, and task list.

### CSS
Defines the application's styling, including:
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode Theme**: The app has a dark background with contrasting colors for accessibility.
- **Hover Effects**: Buttons and checkboxes have hover effects for better user interaction.

### JavaScript
Handles the application logic, including:
- **Task Management**: Adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks complete.
- **Task Counter**: Updates the task completion status.
- **Local Storage**: Saves tasks persistently in the browser.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the To-Do Web App.
- `style.css`: Provides styling for layout and user interface.
- `script.js`: Handles task logic, storage, and interactivity.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Add tasks using the input field, mark them as complete, edit, or delete them.
4. Reload the page to see tasks stored persistently.
