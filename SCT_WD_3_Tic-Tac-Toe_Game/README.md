# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project showcases the skills honed during my internship at SkillCraft Technology, where we focus on developing real-world applications through practical experience. This classic game demonstrates my proficiency in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** while highlighting interactive design, responsive layouts, and engaging user experience.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The game board adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience across devices.
*   **Turn Display and Win Announcement:** The game displays the current player's turn and announces the winner or draw using text and speech synthesis.
*   **Sound Effects:** Invalid moves trigger an audio alert to improve user interaction.
*   **Reset Button:** Players can reset the game and start again at any time.

## How to Play

1.  Open the game in a browser.
2.  Players take turns placing their mark ("X" or "O") by clicking on the grid squares.
3.  The game checks for a win after each move, with victory achieved by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
4.  If all squares are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.
5.  Use the **Reset** button to play a new round.
