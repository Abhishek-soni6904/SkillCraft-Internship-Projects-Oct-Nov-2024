# Stopwatch Application

This project showcases the skills I honed during my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, where we focused on developing real-world applications through practical experience. The stopwatch application demonstrates my proficiency in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** while highlighting interactive design, responsive layouts, and engaging user experiences.

## Features
- **Start/Stop Timer:** Start and stop the timer with a single button click.
- **Lap Recording:** Record multiple lap times and display them in a table.
- **Reset Timer:** Reset the timer and clear lap data.
- **Clear Laps:** Clear all recorded lap times.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML:** Structure of the stopwatch interface.
- **CSS:** Styling, including custom fonts and responsive design for mobile screens.
- **JavaScript:** Timer logic, lap recording, and interaction with the DOM.
